# The Need For DNS
Today's lab uses a new Configuration of the Internet Simulator that includes DNS. A DNS server now appears attached to every router.
To get an IP address, we have “ask” the DNS server using a text-based protocol.

You are going to interview/have a conversation with a classmate using only the Internet Simulator
To find the person, you will have to ask the DNS for her IP address. When you have retrieved the IP address, start the interview. Pick a partner in a different part of the room so that you are not tempted to talk to each other.
*Watch out!* If I ask you to disconnect from the router, you will lose your IP address and have to join the router again.
Your partner will need to determine your new IP before resuming the interview. 

Fill in the directions and answer the questions on [this activity guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PRucTGYp_Ie40aszZvXOKNtTqD4mPzecuWYAAn1g1iI/edit) as you work with your partner.
